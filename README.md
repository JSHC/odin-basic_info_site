# Basic Informational Site

This project is part of the NodeJS course on [The Odin Project website](https://www.theodinproject.com).

The purpose of the project is to use the NodeJS HTTP and File System modules to serve different html files based on incoming http requests as well as serving a 404 page if there isn't a html file for the requested path.

As part of a later task in the course, the project was updated to use express
instead of using just built-in Node functionality.
